# Linear Circuit Modeling 
## Emphasis on Static Converters Simulation

This repo contains the simulations of different linear circuits topologies.

It is employed multiple simulation techniques such as:

1) Backward-Euler

2) Forward-Euler

3) Trapezoidal

4) Runge-Kutta

Python programs were developed in order to observe the different simulation techniques results.

An academic version of PSIM was used in order to validated Python results.
